# Simon
Simon is a game where the player is given a longer and longer randomly generated pattern that they need to repeat back. This game was implemented on an MSP430 with 4 possible LEDs/buttons the player can press. There are also several difficulty levels related to how much time the player is given to remember each part of the pattern. Additionally, the length of the pattern can be scaled in the game code.
